## Usage

### Running the Program with `run.py`

The `run.py` file serves as the main entry point for executing the various functionalities of the ZeroDayZooKeepers_Starterkit. It orchestrates the execution of other scripts in the program, allowing users to perform tasks such as subdomain enumeration, port scanning, SSH file transfers, and moreâ€”all from the terminal.

Important to be located in the following project path: /ZeroZooKeepers_StarterKit/Program before running the run.py command!

### Help Command

Run the following commands for in teminal listing of options available.

```bash
python run.py -h
```

Following is a example when accessing help towrads one of the available scripts to run. The following command can be run specified for each script using the scripts given argparse Script name.

```bash
python run.py scanner -h
```

### How `run.py` Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - When you run `run.py`, it initializes the necessary configurations by loading the `config.json` file. This file contains default settings for various operations, which can be modified according to user preferences.

2. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - The script uses Python's built-in `argparse` module to create a command-line interface. This allows users to specify actions, parameters, and options when running the script from the terminal.

3. **Action Selection**:
   - Users can choose from various actions, such as:
     - **Enumeration**: Initiating subdomain enumeration using the Sublist3r tool.
     - **Scanning**: Performing port scans using Nmap.
     - **SSH Operations**: Uploading or downloading files, or executing scripts on remote servers via SSH.

4. **Example of Running the Program**:
   - To start the program, you would typically run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python run.py --action enumeration --domain example.com --threads 20 --output result.txt
     ```
   - In this example:
     - `--action` specifies the action to perform (in this case, enumeration).
     - `--domain` specifies the target domain for enumeration.
     - `--threads` sets the number of concurrent threads to use during the operation.
     - `--output` determines the name of the output file where results will be saved.

5. **Modular Implementation**:
   - The `run.py` script imports and utilizes various classes from the program:
     - **`enumeration`**: Handles the logic for subdomain enumeration and manages the integration of Sublist3r.
     - **`scanner`**: Manages the port scanning functionalities using Nmap.
     - **`ssh`**: Responsible for establishing SSH connections, transferring files, and executing scripts remotely.
     - **`cipher`**: Insaniating the options for encrypting and decrypting aswell as generating the key.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The script incorporates robust error handling to manage exceptions that may arise during execution, such as invalid input parameters, connection issues, or file access errors. This ensures that the user is informed of any issues and can take corrective action.

7. **Exit Strategy**:
   - If any critical error occurs or if the user opts to terminate the program (by entering "exit" when prompted), the script will gracefully exit and log the necessary information.

### Enumeration Commands

The enumeration script is initiated by typing 'enumerate' after the ` python run.py ` command

#### Command Format enumerate

```bash
python run.py enumerate example.com [-o result.txt] [-t 20]
```
1. Required Arguments
   - Domain: 
     The target domain for subdomain enumeration.

### Cryptography Commands

The Cryptography script is initiated by typing 'cipher' or 'keygen' after the ` python run.py ` command depending on which of the 2 you wanna run.
The cipher module assumes by default that the file to be decryted or encrypted aswell as key files lies in the folder with path: Program/Cipher/Cipher_files, this can be altered with configurations given in chapter 5: [Configuration](#configuration).
All files stored in Cipher_files are gitignored by default to make sure you dont push them by accident.

2. **Optional Arguments**
   - '-o' '--output_file':
     Specify the name of the output file where the encrypted or decrypted data will be saved. Defaults to the value set in the configuration file if not provided.

### Nmap Scanner Commands

The nmap scanning script is initiated by typing 'scanner' after the ` python run.py ` command
The scanner module assumes by default that the files to be read or the output files gets saved and stored in the folder with path: Program/Scanner/Scanner_files, this can be altered with configurations given in chapter 5: [Configuration](#configuration).
All files stored in Scanner_files are gitignored by default to make sure you dont push them by accident.

### SSH Scripts
The program contains a folder where you can store your own scripts made specifically for the ssh portion for quick access. However make sure the scripts you make follow the rough guidelines given in the example script that is part of this project, located in the `SSH_Scripts`folder in the `SSH`folder.

## Logging

The application uses the `logging` module to provide comprehensive logging capabilities, which helps in monitoring and debugging. 

### Purpose of Logging

Logging is an essential feature that allows you to track the application's behavior during execution. It captures important events, errors, and status messages, making it easier to diagnose issues and understand the flow of the application.

### Logging Levels

The following logging levels are used throughout the application:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. This level is used for low-level events.
- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected. This level indicates the general operational status of the application.
- **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., â€˜disk space lowâ€™). The application is still functioning as expected.
- **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform a specific operation.
- **CRITICAL**: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

### Configuring logging

The default logging level can easily be set in the `config.json` file, see chapter 5: [Configuration](#configuration) for more on this.
